<p>Research Setting: Describe in detail the geographical and/or social community that you have selected for your study and the reasons for your selection. Data Collection Method(s): Present a general overview of the method(s) you selected, your reasons for selecting it, and how this is going to be implemented in your data collection. If your research proposal only concentrates on secondary data analysis, you should focus this section on the types of measures that you are going to use in your analysis.</p>
<p>Measures: Describe what measures will be used, the reliability of each measure, the suitability of each measure for the study population. Analytical Methods: Specify the types of methods that you are going to use to analyze your data (e.g., logistic regression, historical trends, and content analysis) and the reasons for your selection. Describe how these methods address specific aims.</p>
<p>Ethical Concerns and Protection of Human Subjects: For all original research and/or secondary data analysis, protection of human subjects must be addressed, i.e., was IRB approval requested and approved, or if not, was this study exempted. This information is usually one or two sentences in the methods section.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Welcome to our p8105 final project. We (Adam, Maria, Ronaé) looked at data concerning flu vaccines, the people who choose to get them and who choose not to get them, and how they feel about vaccines from their candid expressions. We started this project during a tumultuous year, when a COVID-19 vaccine seemed nearly impossible and wearing a mask was a radical gesture in some areas. Coming from different departments, we consider this to be a mixed methods approach to data science. The data provided some interesting findings, and our website highlights some of those for you. We believe that adult immunizations are important, and it’s engagement will push us towards achieving health equity for all.</p>
<p>All the best,</p>
<p>Adam, Maria, Ronaé</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>A few weeks ago, one of our team members gave themselves the equivalent of a paper cut with a metal coffee can. Remembering an episode of Arthur (the aardvark) from childhood, in which Arthur cut himself on a lima bean can and required a tetanus shot, this team member decided to look up her immunization record and found that her last Tdap immunization occurred more than 10 years ago. This anecdote helped us realize: what kind of vaccine schedule are adults on, if any at all? How many individuals know that the tetanus vaccine should be received every ten years? How can we ensure that adults know the proper vaccination schedule in order to ensure maximum health benefit not only for themselves, but for the sake of public health? Our reckoning with immunization schedules leads us to think about the current flu season, guiding us to do a deep dive concerning the influenza vaccine.</p>
<p>Recently, there has been much attention guided towards vaccinations and immunizations. Will there be a COVID-19 vaccine in the near future? Should vaccinations be required for children to attend school? How accessible are facilities that offer vaccines and what are the demographics underlying those who are vaccinated? Before we can predict the future of vaccinations, especially participation in receiving doses, it is important to explore current data about available vaccines. More than ever, we are reminded about the gravity of communicable diseases and how they can completely influence local and international communities. A significant portion of immunizations is focused on children, but what about the adult population? Adult immunization is just as important, but consistently misses the limelight. This project will explore data that contains information regarding flu vaccines, accessibility to obtain the vaccines, and the consequences of not participating in immunization.</p>

<h4>National Health Survey</h4>
<p>The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is one of the major data collection programs of the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) which is part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). While the NHIS has been conducted continuously since 1957, the content of the survey has been updated about every 15-20 years to incorporate advances in survey methodology and coverage of health topics. In January 2019, NHIS launched a redesigned content and structure that differs from its previous questionnaire design. Persons excluded from the sample are those with no fixed household address, military personnel, persons in long-term care institutions, persons in correctional facilities, and U.S. nationals living in foreign countries. Data collection on the NHIS is continuous, i.e., from January to December each year.</p>

<h4>Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)</h4>
<p>The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is the nation’s system of health-related telephone surveys that collect state data about U.S. residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services. Established in 1984 BRFSS completes more than 400,000 adult interviews each year, making it the largest continuously conducted health survey system in the world. The basic philosophy was to collect data on actual behaviors, rather than on attitudes or knowledge, that would be especially useful for planning, initiating, supporting, and evaluating health promotion and disease prevention programs. In addition to age, gender, and race/ethnicity, raking permits more demographic variables to be included in weighting such as education attainment, marital status, tenure (property ownership), and telephone ownership.</p>

<h4>NYC Open Data</h4>
<p>Open Data is an opportunity to engage New Yorkers in the information that is produced and used by City government. In New York City, access to open data is the law. In 2012, the “Open Data Law,” which amended the New York City administrative code to mandate that all public data be made available on a single web portal by the end of 2018. Since then, there have been several amendments approved to the Open Data Law. These laws, which include stronger requirements on data dictionaries and data retention, response timelines for public requests, and an extension of the Open Data mandate into perpetuity, help make it easier for New Yorkers to access City data online and anchor the city’s transparency initiatives around Open Data.</p>

<p><strong>not sure where to put framework in this regard.will resolve this later</strong></p>
<p>Framework</p>
<p>Our project is based on our research questions</p>
<p>“What are the attitudes of adults regarding the seasonal influenza vaccine?”</p>
<p>“What trends emerge adults’ seasonal influenza vaccine?”</p>
<p>“What are the effects that result from adult’s engagement or disengagement with the seasonal influenza vaccine?”</p>
<p>Attitudes structure can be described in terms of three components. o Affective component: this involves a person’s feelings / emotions about the attitude object. “I hate vaccines”. o Behavioral (or conative) component: the way the attitude we have influences on how we act or behave. For example: “I will obtain a influenza vaccine once it becomes available”. o Cognitive component: this involves a person’s belief / knowledge about an attitude object. For example: “I believe vaccines are safe”. Through engagement with the allotted datasets we will begin to understand 1. What feelings do adults have regarding flu vaccines? Why? This will help us understand how adults might feel in regards to available or theoretical vaccines. 2. How do adults behave towards flu vaccines? Why? This will help us understand what actions should be encouraged or discontinued in regards to available or theoretical vaccines 3. What do adults know about vaccines? Why? This will help us understand gaps in education, misinformation that might be occurring, and where information should be directed towards Hypothesis/ What do we think we will find? - The proportion of individuals who receive a flu vaccine will increase over the years - There might be a decrease in flu vaccinations due to the Anti-Vaxx movement - Communities with lower allocations of resources will have less access to obtain vaccinations - Insurance coverage will have a significant association with vaccination status - There will be more individuals with polarizing views on vaccines than those with indifferent stances Research aim Highlights trends in flu vaccine data to ultimately support efforts in research and program implementation, to ensure that all of those eligible to obtain a flu vaccine to get one. This is in a desire to encourage immunization rates for other communicable disease, especially for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
